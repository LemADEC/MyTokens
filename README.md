=== MyTokens ===
=== What is MyTokens ===
MyTokens is a plugin designed to be easy to use and very powerful. It currently supports 2 ways users can get tokens with a random drop chance and all drop chances and amounts are changeable. Currently you can get Tokens from Block breaking and PVP (Both can be turned on and off).

* The shop in MyTokens is completely hard coded into the plugin with the ability to edit the //shops.yml// file to override the default shop (Up to 53 items can be in the shop)
* The drop rates can be changed and updated on the fly in the //config.yml//
* The Plugin separates admin and user commands to be easier for server admins to do permissions
* MyTokens has a full in-depth //config.yml// with the ability to enable and disable features, you can over ride nearly anything and everything about how the tokens work
